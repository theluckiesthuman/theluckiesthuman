Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you'll find a collection of projects and repositories that showcase my skills and experience in software development, with a focus on Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Rust, and more.

## About Me
I am a passionate software engineer with expertise in building scalable and reliable applications. My primary programming language is Golang, and I have extensive experience working with other technologies and frameworks such as Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Rust. I enjoy tackling complex problems and designing robust solutions that meet the highest quality standards.

## Areas of Expertise
Golang: I have a deep understanding of the Go programming language and its ecosystem. I have developed various projects, including RESTful APIs, microservices, and command-line tools using Go.

### Docker: 
I am proficient in creating containerized applications using Docker. I have experience in Dockerizing applications, optimizing Docker images, and orchestrating containers with Docker Compose.

### Kubernetes: 
I have hands-on experience in deploying and managing applications on Kubernetes clusters. I can create Kubernetes manifests, configure deployments, services, and persistent storage for highly available and scalable applications.

### PostgreSQL:
I am well-versed in working with PostgreSQL as a reliable and performant database. I have designed database schemas, written complex queries, and optimized database performance.

### Kafka: 
I have utilized Kafka as a message broker in various projects, enabling real-time data processing and event-driven architectures. I can design Kafka topics, consumers, and producers to build scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

### Rust: 
I am currently exploring Rust as a systems programming language. I find its performance, safety guarantees, and memory management capabilities fascinating and have started to develop small projects using Rust.
